Module 12 Challenge NoSQL

In this challenge, I work for a food magazine called "Eat, Safe, Love," and I will analyze food hygiene rating data on UK restaurants collected by the UK Food Standards Agency. 

In part 1 of this assignment, I imported a JSON file containing food hygiene data into MongoDB Compass. I double checked that I imported correctly by listing the database, collection, and documents within VSCode. In part 2, I updated the food hygiene data set with food data from a new restaurant that opened in Greenwich. In part 3 of this assignment, I performed exploratory analysis to inform the audience reading "Eat, Safe, Love" which restaurants are worth trying and which restaurants should be avoided. 

**Due to the large file size of the Jupyter notebooks, code is unable to render and is not viewable in GitHub. So, the files need to be downloaded in order to access them.
